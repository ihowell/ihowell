# Hi There!

## TL;DR: I am researcher working at https://phaidra.ai/, working to reduce carbon emmissions when cooling large industrial plants and data centers!

- Currently researching: constrained optimization

In the past, I have worked on the use of visualization of backtrack search when solving a constraint satisfaction problem. For my undergraduate thesis, I developed an educational and research tool visualizing how Sudoku can be solved using the Constraint Satisfaction Problem framework, and how this framework is beneficial. This tool can be found at https://sudoku.unl.edu

### I enjoy working with

Deep learning, Constrained Optimization, Constraint Satisfaction, Python, C++, and Rust!
